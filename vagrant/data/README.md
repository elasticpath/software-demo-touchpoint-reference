The software-data.jar is a slightly different version of the data contained in this folder.
It is tweaked to be used by the deployment-package-customizer project that enhances The Pusher.

The changes are:
* Comment out the system config entry in the manifest so that it isn't imported
* Alter the import confgiguration so it matches what The Pusher expects
